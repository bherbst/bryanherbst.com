title: Autofill in Compose 1.8.0
---
In 2021 [I wrote a bit about Jetpack Compose's support for autofill](/2021/04/13/compose-autofill). At the time the APIs were pretty clunky to use. Back then you needed to wrap your composable in an `AutofillNode`, manually add it to a autofill node tree, and manage updating your text field's state yourself.

[Compose UI 1.8.0](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-ui) introduces new autofill APIs that address many of these shortcomings. The new APIs are more concise and make it easier to support autofill with Jetpack Compose.

<!--more-->

## The new semantic autofill
Autofill configuration is now offered through Compose's semantics framework. All you need to do is set a `contentType` semantic property!

For example, add `ContentType.EmailAddress` to configure a `TextField` to autofill email addresses:

```kotlin
var email by rememberTextFieldState()
TextField(
    email = email,
    modifier = Modifier.semantics { contentType = ContentType.EmailAddress }
)
```

Easy!

You can also declare that a text field can accept multiple types of autofilled content.  If you support authentication via an email address or a phone number you can allow autofilling both:
```kotlin
Modifier.semantics { 
  contentType = ContentType.EmailAddress + ContentType.PhoneNumber
}
```

## Manipulating autofilled content
If you are using the `TextField` variants that take in a `value` you can use `onValueChange` to manipulate the inserted text.

You could, for example, convert the input text to uppercase:

```kotlin
  TextField(
    value = emailAddress,
    onValueChange = { emailAddress = it.uppercase() },
    modifier = modifier.semantics { contentType = ContentType.EmailAddress },
  )
```

If you are using `TextFieldState` you can [use `TextField`'s new `inputTransformation` and `outputTransformation` APIs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/text/user-input?textfield=state-based#modify-user-input):

Or uppercase-ing TextField would look something like this:
```kotlin
  TextField(
    state = emailState,
    modifier = modifier.semantics { contentType = ContentType.EmailAddress },

    // Swap this for an `inputTransformation` to uppercase the actual state
    // This only visually shows uppercase
    outputTransformation = OutputTransformation {
      replace(0, length, toString().uppercase())
    }
  )
```

## Also improved: Autofill highlighting
One shortcoming I noted in my original blog post was that Compose autofill didn't highlight inputs automatically. Autofill with Views set a yellow background to inform users that a field was autofilled. The new Compose autofill does this! Well, sometimes.

This works out-of-the-box if you use the `TextField` with the `state: TextFieldState` overload. It _should_ work for the `value` overloads as well but [there is a bug](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/424384055) and the highlight draws behind the field. _Update: this bug has been fixed in AOSP and should be available in a new Material release soon!_

## Fixed: Text context menu support
The old implementation didn't support showing an "autofill" option in the context menu. It does now! This allows users to manually trigger autofill when needed.

## Other types of inputs
You can use these autofill semantics with other types of inputs too! 

Say you want a switch that automatically checks itself if an email address starts with an "E". You can do this by using the `onAutofillText` semantic property to get a callback when autofill provides you with text:

```kotlin
var firstLetterE by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
Switch(
  modifier = Modifier.semantics {
    contentType = ContentType.EmailAddress

    // We need to declare a data type explicitly since this isn't a TextField
    contentDataType = ContentDataType.Text

    onAutofillText { text ->
      firstLetterE = text.startsWith("E", ignoreCase = true)
      true
    }
  },
  checked = firstLetterE,
  onCheckedChange =  { firstLetterE = it },
)
```

This may seem like a silly feature (it is), but this technique can also power auto-fillable dropdowns or radio boxes for birthdates, genders, or other fields. 
     
The are also other `ContentDataTypes` available for lists, toggles, and dates, but those are [not yet implemented]( https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:compose/ui/ui/src/androidMain/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/autofill/AndroidAutofillManager.android.kt;l=210-221?q=onAutofillText&ss=androidx%2Fplatform%2Fframeworks%2Fsupport).

## Conclusion
Compose 1.8.0â€™s new autofill APIs are a big improvement for developers. Autofilling fields now requires significantly less code and offers more functionality. Compose is close to have feature parity with the View framework now!
