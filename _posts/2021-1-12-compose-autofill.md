title: Autofill with Jetpack Compose
---
Autofill is one of my absolute favorite features added to Android in the past few years. I desperately want to never need to manually type in my address and credit card information ever again. When I need to enter this type of information in an app that doesn't support autofill I immediately dislike the app and tend to avoid it in the future.

With Jetpack Compose on the horizon, app developers are (hopefully!) wondering how to support autofill in their Compose UI.
