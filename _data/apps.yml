    I worked on this app for a few years!

    At its peak, it had over 5 million active installs on Android, and over 30 million total users across all channels.

    Target has since merged Cartwheel into the main "Target" application.

    Cartwheel is a mobile savings application for Target shoppers. You get offers
    for tons of different products without ever needing to cut out a coupon!

- title: Fall

    Fall was primarily an experiment in creating a mobile game and leveraging
    Google Play Services. I no longer am actively developing it.

    Fall is a variant of the classic FallDown game in which you control a ball falling through the sky, dodging platforms in order to avoid hitting the top of the screen. In this variant, gravity randomly switches directions as you fall!

    Logomotion Scorer was my first Android application published to the Play Store. It is a simple app for scoring the 2011 FIRST Robotics Competition game, [Logomotion](http://usfirst.org/aboutus/content.aspx?id=18793).

    I no longer actively maintain it, and it is a FroYo-era Android app (so don't expect anything beautiful).
